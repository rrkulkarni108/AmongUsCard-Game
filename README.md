## Storyline
Oh no! You are stranded on a broken space ship in outer space! 
You and your crewmates have to finish the task bar in order to fix the ship and 
get back home! 

Along the way, an imposter may pretend to help you finish your tasks but 
BEWARE the imposter is there to sabotage your tasks and make it harder for
 you to fix the ship!
 
## How to get this on your computer
- Download from GitHub: click the green button named "Code", then click on "Download Zipped File" from the dropdown

## Rules : How to Play
- Each player is given 5 cards in the beginning of the game
- Each player may pick up as many cards as they want per turn until the hand is full 
- A playerâ€™s hand is full when they have 8 cards 
- After picking up cards each player must put down one card per turn

- In the 2 player mode there is a time limit of 7 minutes
